    <template #title>What are the pros of PESU?</template>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Great placements if you are in CSE:</strong> Major MNCs visit every year and the packages are great and increase every year. Back in 2018 when I joined it had one of the best placements for CS, probably is the same now too. A good number of companies come for summer internships between 3rd and final year as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Updated syllabus:</strong> The syllabi for all courses is more or less pretty up-to-date with recent advancements, but there are 2 sides to this.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Great crowd:</strong> The crowd here has always been top-notch, you will find really great people here who are competitive and will push you to do better. PES has always been known for this. There are a lot of people who will inspire you with their achievements. The seniors are great as well, there is a discord server which contains over 3000+ members from all the recent PESU batches. This is probably PESU&#x27;s saving grace.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Location:</strong> Kind of self-explanatory, being in Bangalore has its advantages by bringing in more opportunities. Additionally, if you live near any metro line you have connectivity as well (EC campus apparently will get connected soon too).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A lot of clubs and a lot of hackathons:</strong> There is a hackathon happening every other week here, plus there is a large assortment of clubs to choose from: so you get enough opportunities to take part in events. While this might seem like a nice advantage, it comes with its own share of problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scholarships:</strong> There are many scholarships every semester for multiple ranges of performers, giving you a lot of opportunities to get some financial returns, including top performers in the entire batch, top performers per branch etc. Although you will be eligible for only one scholarship at a time, it&#x27;s nice to have these options.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative choices to hostel:</strong> PES RR campus is surrounded by affordable PGs and apartments. If you don&#x27;t like the hostel or were late to get a room, there are a lot of backup options at arm&#x27;s length.
<br><br></p>

<br>
<doc-panel id="what-are-the-cons-of-pesu" collapsed>
    <template #title>What are the cons of PESU?</template>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>PESU&#x27;s only reputation comes from CS:</strong> The other branches are ignored and even the management does nothing to promote them. If you are in these other branches, you will miss out on a lot of the benefits PESU has.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Placement stats are skewed in favour of CS:</strong> Building on the first point, the advertised placement stats are always for CS. This is a misrepresentation because people from other branches do not get packages even half of what CS kids get.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The updated syllabus is superficial:</strong> The syllabus although updated, is in name only. Most courses will dedicate only 5-10 slides of a PPT to the &quot;recent developments&quot;, glancing over these topics. Some courses will just mention their names. It is nowhere close to covering the amount to justify the syllabus being &quot;updated&quot;. For a majority of the courses, the syllabus is the same as what it was 7-8 years ago. Additionally, if you are in CS at least, most of what skills you need to get a job in the industry aren&#x27;t covered. You will need to spend extensive time apart from the syllabus to make yourself qualified for a job.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Campus is tiny:</strong> If you are a fan of large open spaces, this place believes in the opposite (at least for RR). It is like a concrete jungle with buildings all around and construction happening most of the time. EC campus on the other hand is beautiful but I am not sure what is the state of it currently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Crowded and packed:</strong> self-explanatory again, the sheer number of people makes it packed all the time, and competition for CS placements increases exponentially. Other things get affected as well such as chances for opportunities at clubs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Faculty is mediocre:</strong> Biggest issue here, professors have been leaving left, right and centre. Issues such as dissatisfaction with the management, too much work etc. All the good profs have left long ago, leaving the bad ones. Profs who made the Uni what it is today, ones who headed research clubs etc have all ditched. The bad ones are leaving now too. Additionally, there are rumours of profs of axed branches (such as the old Civil branch, etc) are still being tied down to PES by the management. They are being trained in introductory courses of different branches so they are still useful (and the acute shortage of faculty). Here, you will find a single faculty member teaching a wide array of courses across different fields, even if they do not specialise in them. A good number of research labs have even shut down.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Management is poor:</strong> Even a rock is more intelligent sometimes. They take illogical decisions that do not make sense, screw around and experiment on batches and then pin the responsibility on you. The management is a mockery of what it should be. From placements to examination stuff, a lot of it needs improvement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stressful environment:</strong> Mentioned multiple times here, the biweekly ISA system leaves you no room for working on your skills and interests. You have tests every 2 weeks, and between those tests multiple labs, assignments, project(s) etc. It is very hectic, and you are constantly jumping from one deliverable to the other. The only relief that kicks in is at the end of the semester. There are some floating rumours about them moving to a 3-ISA system, but no confirmation on that yet. In some cases, it might feel like a school, sometimes worse. It is academically it is so rigorous that I currently feel my job functionality at my office is barely anything that I went through here.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Facilities are okay at best:</strong> Infrastructure in the labs is okay at best. It is nothing world-class, it only gets the job done. You also need to jump through multiple hoops to gain permissions for things and is a cumbersome affair. Simple things such as the WiFi have multiple restrictions and you&#x27;ll even ironically find unblocked porn sites but blocked educational videos on YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fests are yet to return to their pre-COVID capacity:</strong> they are around 80-90% back, but not all fests have returned yet. But this is pretty much a transient issue and should be resolved in a year or two. Fests apart from that aren&#x27;t too many, however, so do not expect ground-breaking fests to happen every other month. They&#x27;re great, but nothing extraordinary. This is subjective, so I am not going to comment more on this.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Club and Hackathon quality are severely diluted:</strong> Having 15 clubs with quality events is way better than having 45 clubs in which most of them do not do anything. In fact, there are so many at this point that you would not recognise a few anymore. Clubs in CSE are also being run under some weird &quot;vertical&quot; concept, with less student management and more teacher involvement. This has been explained in detail before but the summary is that the old clubs that used to exist have mostly died because of the CSE management and been replaced by shoddy replacements (which have also died kekw). Hackathons happening every week do not make sense: the quality of projects being displayed has gone down drastically. People at these hackathons now build anything that was planned over a few days, instead of spending weeks/months like before to plan a good product (back when hackathons were at most twice a semester).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insanely high fees:</strong> this keeps increasing every year. It isn&#x27;t really worth it if you are joining through management (which is 11 LPA now). KCET/PESSAT fee is a little high but is expected knowing them. Since this is again subjective, not commenting more.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stringent attendance policy:</strong> pretty strict at 80% (it used to be 85% before), combined with the constant workload it doesn&#x27;t give you much room to do things beyond prepare for the tests and attend classes. If your attendance is low, they&#x27;ll make you attend extra classes to cover up. If it&#x27;s too low for even extra classes to help, you won&#x27;t be allowed to write the semester exam for that course.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Weird hostel rules:</strong> I cannot comment in detail about this since I didn&#x27;t personally stay in the hostel, but there are some stringent rules regarding the dress code (no shorts allowed) and curfew timings. Back when I was there, the curfew time for boys was 8 pm and for girls was 7 pm. There are also regular checks every week. Additionally, the girl&#x27;s hostel isn&#x27;t on campus and is about 2km away. There is more to this point, preferably ask someone in the hostel right now.

<doc-panel id="what-are-the-differences-between-rr-campus-and-ec-campus" collapsed>
    <template #title>What are the differences between RR Campus and EC Campus?</template>
<p>If you absolutely want PES, then CSE is best here. But you shouldn&#x27;t go for this route. Branch matters a lot, especially if you intend to pursue higher education. I have a couple of points regarding the campus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trust me, the campuses are the same. I graduated last year and I&#x27;ve seen the two campuses being almost the same. RR has more fancy buildings, EC has a spacious and open campus. RR feels very crowded, dense and packed, and the campus is essentially roads between buildings. But yes, the buildings at RR are newer and are very fancy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Facilities wise, tech clubs (assuming you&#x27;ll be interested in these) are currently much better at EC campus - so if you&#x27;re focusing on CS/ECE, you&#x27;d want to be part of the club culture at EC. RR has probably 10x the number of clubs compared to EC, but over 80% of them are dead and almost all of them are mediocre. EC has fewer clubs overall, but the tech clubs at EC are currently unmatched. A few people will say that RR has weekly Hackathons - this is actually a bad thing. The quality of these hacks are severely diluted and most of them are poor. On the other hand, Hackathons at EC might be sporadic, but they always promise quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Research clubs at both campuses have gone to shit so it isn&#x27;t a discriminator anymore. As a student you can take part in clubs at both campuses and internships at these research clubs are open to both. So again, not a discriminator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The only major difference are the fests. RR fests are significantly better than EC, no denying. But as a student, you&#x27;re open to take part in either. So you may not get to organise the bigshot fests, but you&#x27;ll definitely get to take part in them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Placements are pooled, so again not a discriminator. Placements take place together for both RR and EC campuses, EC campus kids need to come to RR campus and give interviews during placements. Companies don&#x27;t know which campus a particular student is from so they can&#x27;t really distinguish between candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, some people online will claim that companies prefer RR campus more and that these companies &quot;somehow&quot; know which campus a candidate is from. These claims are false and the reason for more RR campus kids getting selected is simple statistics. RR campus has double (if not more) the number of students than EC campus. My batch (2022) had 600 CS in RR and 300 CS in EC campus. Which meant, that the probability of an RR campus student getting selected is ~67%, which is double the probability of an EC campus student getting selected at ~33%. Because of the large difference in number of candidates at both campuses, it will obviously look like favouritism and partiality to the naked eye. Each campus&#x27; student has an equal shot at placements, it just appears to be one sided because of the skewed distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Faculty is equally unqualified at both, profs leaving both campuses and the remaining ones are mediocre. So again, can&#x27;t really compare. I&#x27;d say profs at RR might be marginally better, but it&#x27;s barely enough to call it a difference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, your campus at the end of the day will mean nothing. It will matter only to you for exactly 3 years (Final year nobody comes to college). Neither your degree, nor any official documentation from PES at the end of your 4 years will contain the campus name. When you apply for jobs, or go for higher education, your campus won&#x27;t mean anything. It&#x27;s a choice that will only support your education for 3 years - after that it&#x27;s irrelevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO, the main comparisons that you should make are very subjective parameters such as travel costs, distance from your place, etc. Apart from that, if fests are a dealbreaker for you and you&#x27;re someone who has a wide range of interests beyond tech clubs, then RR. If you&#x27;re okay with not organising (because you can always take part) the largest fests, and would like to only take part in tech related clubs, then EC. But as I said - these differences will only exist for 3 years: after that the campus you graduate from is irrelevant.

    <template #title>How to switch branch/campus?</template>
<p>So although it is possible, branch change to CSE is extremely difficult because it depends on a lot of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Seats are limited:</strong> CSE seats only free up when people leave seats and every year there are only a handful (my batch had 3-4 changes only)</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to be at the top of your batch to even be considered for branch change. Even if seats are available, CGPA plays a role in the priority order. Someone currently in mechanical with a better CGPA than someone in let&#x27;s say someone in ECE will have more priority of changing branches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I remember correctly, changes from EC CSE to RR CSE are given more priority than complete branch changes. This will again put you at a disadvantage</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are competing with an insane number of people to shift branches since both campuses are considered (number of people across all branches and campuses with 9.5+ will be atleast 30 and available seats are handful), it does not really work out for almost everyone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you join EEE with the intention of getting CSE in the second year I would suggest don&#x27;t. I will not comment on whether you are capable of doing it, but chances are thinner than a hair.

<doc-panel id="what-is-a-backlog" collapsed>
    <template #title>What is a backlog?</template>
<p>I&#x27;ll just explain from the beginning to make things clear for everyone.</p>
<p>If you fail (or withdraw) a course, you will need to pass it to get your degree. If you do not clear it, you won&#x27;t be given your degree, your transcript will always show that you have a pending backlog (only if you fail, not withdraw), and you will not be allowed to sit for placements. Now, you can clear backlogs during two specific moments in the year:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Summer backlog exam:</strong> If you choose to do this, then in the next summer break between the even and the odd semesters, you&#x27;ll have to give the backlog exam again.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Normal course exam:</strong> If you choose to do this, then you&#x27;ll have to take up the exam for this the next time the course is again held. In most cases this is the next year with the next batch (so if you fail a course in 3rd semester, you&#x27;ll have to take the course again the next 3rd semester kids take it, so you&#x27;ll be in 5th semester).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you pass via any of the methods, you&#x27;ve passed the course. One thing to note is, regardless of the option you choose, if you need to give a backlog you will only be evaluated on the exam: all 100 marks for the course will be taken from your ESA paper, you will not have any ISA, assignment or project components. Additionally, you can take backlog exams as many times as you need to pass a course, but do remember that each backlog exam costs money.</p>
<p>Also if I&#x27;m not wrong, you will always have an indication that you had a backlog but it was cleared on your transcript.</p>
<p>PS - Backlog exams apparently tend to be easier in the summer. No concrete proof to support this though - just PESU lore.</p>
<p>PPS - Funnily, I&#x27;ve heard of some people who know they are going to screw up their ESA withdraw from their exam and instead choose to give a backlog exam in the summer to pass it. This has 2 advantages: you haven&#x27;t failed the course so it doesn&#x27;t count as a &quot;backlog&quot; so you don&#x27;t end up with a mark on your transcript, and it doesn&#x27;t consider your ISAs or other deliverables, so if you&#x27;ve screwed up in those it doesn&#x27;t affect your overall score anymore. Now whether people actually went ahead with this, I&#x27;m not sure. Do this at your own peril - I don&#x27;t hold any responsibility for exploiting this loophole.
